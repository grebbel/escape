The story ends abruptly. I asked my family what happened when he was ‘liberated’ by the soviet army? Did he go back to his home-village Brzeznica?

Many Polish soldiers that fought on the side of the allied forces and returned to Poland were tortured and/or murdered by the Russians. Many such stories were told to me when I lived in Poland during the 80s.
