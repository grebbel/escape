# Hunger {#hunger}

We were so tired that we could not move much forward. We went a few miles, picked up potato leftovers in the field and like piglets stuffed them into us. So we hastened to dawn. It was terribly cold. We could not recognise each other in the morning. Dirty, tired, cold, we went further. The villages were still asleep. At times, there was a rooster's sound or dog barking. We happened to meet some soldier, but without a word we went on without asking him anything.

For us it was all the same now. We walked all day with small stops. We did not bypass the villages; Either we will come or we will die. We only eat carrots. On the way we found a corn field where we rested and ate a little. By evening we reached a village. Our march stopped by the trenches.

They were freshly dug, which intrigued us so much. Is there an Eastern Front already? We were afraid to go on. We landed in the roadside heap. Terrible cold and wind with rain did not give us any rest. We huddled together to warm ourselves up, but it did not help much.

Dawn. At a distance of 300 m from the heap stood a newly built large barrack. In the distance the village, and near the trenches stretched far away.

For long time no one was seen. Strangely calm. Terrible hunger began to sting us. There was no carrots or cabbage to be found in the vicinity. Around 10 o'clock it stopped raining. Underneath our pile came a boy and started to collect potatoes, which after the rain were easily visible. I went to him. I learned that Poles lived in the barrack, and for a period they were taken by Germans to dig trenches. Today is Sunday, so they do not work. He could not tell us where we were. At my request went to call a better-oriented colleague. Around 15:00 hour his colleague came. He also did not know much or did not want to tell us. He went out to find and bring a map for which we did not waited.

Night had fallen. The wind rose and it began to rain. What to do? We do not lose hope. If there are Poles in the camp, then some help will be given to us. I took off the uniform. Only in a sweater, without a hat, I went to the barrack. Bolek stayed for backup. I walked into the barrack. Party on the whole. Harmony plays from ear to ear. Nobody paid attention to me. I got to one of the elder men. It turned out he was from my region. He gave me bread and butter. The second portion I took for Bolek. After a long search, my friend came from under the heap. He dit not give me the map. He probably was afraid. I received a card from him to buy 2 kg of bread. None of the persons, however, could tell me exactly where we were. I went out. Bolek was already impatient.

We continued our journey. We walked along the railroad track. In the morning we came to a city. From the distance there were church towers. It was dark yet, and the ranks of people, with something like arms on their shoulders, were hurrying to the trenches. This made the impression of military manoeuvres, all the more when they started shooting with machine guns, and along the track was advancing an infantry. Under the light bulb we managed to escape to the pine grove. These were just military exercises.

It started to brighten up. Machine guns stopped firing. More and closer to us were the sounds of German commands. I reached out to the edge of the forest and saw straight in front of me the copse marching company of the army. Under the grove they stopped. They spread all the instruments for gun training. The soldiers divided into groups and started the training. Our location was tragic. Exiting into the open field would mean they will detect us. It could end up in a chase. Staying at the spot was also dangerous because during the break in the exercises the soldiers could enter the woods and would notice us. We stayed, however.

As we had predicted, there was a break in the exercises and several Germans entered the grove to help themselves with their physiological needs. We were unnoticed. To our joy, it began to rain. The company stopped the firing training and marched back.
